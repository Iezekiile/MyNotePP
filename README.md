# MyNote

**MyNote** is an app that serves as my "learning sandbox" for experimenting with and testing various Android technologies. The project is designed to combine different tools and libraries to bring my learning closer to real-world projects.

This app allows users to create, edit, and store notes and checklists while offering a wide range of customization options: users can adjust themes, toggle between light and dark modes, switch languages, and choose fonts.
